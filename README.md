Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned by:  
- Removing records where **quantity < 1** (returns were stored as negative values).  
- Excluding records where **unit price < 0** (data entry errors).  
- Using conditional formulas and data transformation techniques to filter out incorrect data.  

### 2. **Visualizations Created**  
The following visualizations were built in **Power BI**:  

#### **Question 1: Revenue Time Series (2011)**  
- A time series analysis of revenue for **each month in 2011**.  
- Helps the CEO understand **seasonal trends** and make future forecasts.
